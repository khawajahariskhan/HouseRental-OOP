House Rental System – C++ OOP Project
📌 Project Overview
This is a House Rental Management System built in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system allows users to browse available houses, rent properties, return them, and manage rental data efficiently. Designed as a console-based application, the system simulates real-world rental operations while implementing key OOP concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

🚀 Features

🧱 OOP Concepts Used
Classes and Objects – Represent houses, users, and system actions.

Inheritance – Base class User, derived classes Admin and Customer.

Polymorphism – Overridden methods for role-specific behaviors.

Encapsulation – Data is secured using private/protected access specifiers.

Constructors/Destructors – Manage object lifecycle and initialization.

🛠 Technologies Used
Language: C++

Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming

Platform: Console Application

👨‍💻 How to Run
Open the .cpp file in any C++ IDE (like Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, or Visual Studio).

Compile and run the project.

Use the login interface to access customer/admin menus.

Navigate through rental options via menu choices.

📚 Future Enhancements
GUI integration using Qt
